# Takuzu

Takuzu, also known as Binairo, is a logic puzzle involving placement of two symbols, often 1s and 0s, on a rectangular grid. The objective is to fill the grid with 1s and 0s, where there is an equal number of 1s and 0s in each row and column and no more than two of either number adjacent to each other. Additionally, there can be no identical rows or columns. Similar to Sudoku, each puzzle begins with several squares in the grid already filled. 

# Rules

> There must be an equal number of 0s and 1s in each row and column. Since this example is an 8Ã—8 grid, that means there should be four 0s and four 1s in each row and column.

> There cannot be more than two 0s or 1s next to each other.
> The layout of each row and column much be unique; that is, no two rows or columns can be the same.
